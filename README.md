## Getting Started

### `yarn`

Installs the relevant project dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
